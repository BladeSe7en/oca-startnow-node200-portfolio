            <p class="p mt-4 mb-4">Hangman was a side project that I completed outside of my class. The picture you see to the left is the main landing page. This page gives the 
              user a brief introduction to how the game works. I have plans in the future to add more functionality to this app by adding a leaderboard, a hint 
              button that would use one strike to give the user a synonym of the word or use an addional strike to get the definition of the word as well. To start
              the game the user must enter in a catagory and hit the start game button.

            <p class="p mt-4 mb-4">The picture to the right is the main game page. on this page you can see the main gallow where the charactor will render when you guess correctly. 
              The input guess box only accepts one letter at a time and upon hitting the guess button it will run a function that will check if that selected letter 
              is in current word. from there it will render the letter in the mapped out word, keep a list of all letters guessed and add on segment of the charactor 
              on the gallow if you guess incorrectly.

            <p class="p mt-4 mb-4">The picture to the left is one portion of my code that handles selecting the current word. To do this, my code takes the catagory the user entered
              and sends it to the datamuse.com API. The response returns 100 different words in an array of objects. The code then uses Math.random() to select 
              a random number to use as the index selector in the array. Finally, this function will take selected word, split the word into an array for the map 
              function, and set the state of the current word.
