            <p>
                   I got into programming through my passion for video games and Lego robotics.
               In my early teens I started off building little creations with my Lego Mindstorms set.
               I would spend hours at a time building and programming my creations to follow a track and avoid various objects around my room.
               <p>
              </p>
                     From there, I got into creating small mods and maps for a few of the video games that I play. Of course I had no clue what I was doing at the time.
                I would tweak various files and completely break the code a thousand times before finding a line of code that actually worked.
                <p>
              </p>
                       For the last five years I was working in the pest control industry and not getting anything out of my job. So at the age of 29, I decided
                  to go back to school to pursue a more meaningful career. I graduated from Origin Coding Academy in November 2018 and am eager 
                  to work in a field that I actually enjoy.
